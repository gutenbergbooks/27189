<p><span class="smcap">Again</span> war. Again sufferings, necessary to nobody,
utterly uncalled for; again fraud; again the universal
stupefaction and brutalization of men.</p>
<p>Men who are separated from each other by thousands
of miles, hundreds of thousands of such men (on the
one hand&mdash;Buddhists, whose law forbids the killing,
not only of men, but of animals; on the other hand&mdash;Christians,
professing the law of brotherhood and love)
like wild beasts on land and on sea are seeking out each
other, in order to kill, torture, and mutilate each other
in the most cruel way. What can this be? Is it a
dream or a reality? Something is taking place which
should not, cannot be; one longs to believe that it is a
dream and to awake from it. But no, it is not a dream,
it is a dreadful reality!</p>
<p>One could yet understand how a poor, uneducated,
defrauded Japanese, torn from his field and taught that
Buddhism consists not in compassion to all that lives,
but in sacrifices to idols, and how a similar poor illiterate
fellow from the neighborhood of Toula or Nijni Novgorod,
who has been taught that Christianity consists
in worshipping Christ, the Madonna, Saints, and their
ikons&mdash;one could understand how these unfortunate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2">2</a></span>
men, brought by the violence and deceit of centuries to
recognize the greatest crime in the world&mdash;the murder
of one's brethren&mdash;as a virtuous act, can commit these
dreadful deeds, without regarding themselves as being
guilty in so doing.</p>
<p>But how can so-called enlightened men preach war,
support it, participate in it, and, worst of all, without
suffering the dangers of war themselves, incite others
to it, sending their unfortunate defrauded brothers to
fight? These so-called enlightened men cannot possibly
ignore, I do not say the Christian law, if they recognize
themselves to be Christians, but all that has been
written, is being written, has and is being said, about the
cruelty, futility, and senselessness of war. They are regarded
as enlightened men precisely because they know
all this. The majority of them have themselves written
and spoken about this. Not to mention The Hague Conference,
which called forth universal praise, or all the
books, pamphlets, newspaper articles, and speeches
demonstrating the possibility of the solution of international
misunderstandings by international arbitration&mdash;no
enlightened man can help knowing that the
universal competition in the armaments of States
must inevitably lead them to endless wars, or to a
general bankruptcy, or to both the one and the other.
They cannot but know that besides the senseless, purposeless
expenditure of milliards of roubles, <i>i.e.</i> of
human labor, on the preparations for war, during the
wars themselves millions of the most energetic and
vigorous men perish in that period of their life which
is best for productive labor (during the past century
wars have destroyed fourteen million men). Enlightened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3">3</a></span>
men cannot but know that occasions for war are
always such as are not worth not only one human life,
but not one hundredth part of all that which is spent
upon wars (in fighting for the emancipation of the
negroes much more was spent than it would have cost
to redeem them from slavery).</p>
<p>Every one knows and cannot help knowing that,
above all, wars, calling forth the lowest animal passions,
deprave and brutalize men. Every one knows
the weakness of the arguments in favor of war, such
as were brought forward by De Maistre, Moltke, and
others, for they are all founded on the sophism that in
every human calamity it is possible to find an advantageous
element, or else upon the utterly arbitrary
assertion that wars have always existed and therefore
always must exist, as if the bad actions of men could
be justified by the advantages or the usefulness which
they realize, or by the consideration that they have
been committed during a long period of time. All
so-called enlightened men know all this. Then suddenly
war begins, and all this is instantly forgotten,
and the same men who but yesterday were proving
the cruelty, futility, the senselessness of wars now
think, speak, and write only about killing as many
men as possible, about ruining and destroying the
greatest possible amount of the productions of human
labor, and about exciting as much as possible the
passion of hatred in those peaceful, harmless, industrious
men who by their labor feed, clothe, maintain
these same pseudo-enlightened men, who compel them
to commit those dreadful deeds contrary to their conscience,
welfare, or faith.</p>

<div class="new-h2">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4">4</a></span></p>
<h2>II</h2>

<p>Something is taking place incomprehensible and
impossible in its cruelty, falsehood, and stupidity.
The Russian Tsar, the same man who exhorted all the
nations in the cause of peace, publicly announces
that, notwithstanding all his efforts to maintain the
peace so dear to his heart (efforts which express themselves
in the seizing of other peoples' lands and in the
strengthening of armies for the defence of these stolen
lands), he, owing to the attack of the Japanese, commands
that the same shall be done to the Japanese
as they had commenced doing to the Russians&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
that they should be slaughtered; and in announcing
this call to murder he mentions God, asking the Divine
blessing on the most dreadful crime in the world. The
Japanese Emperor has proclaimed the same thing in
relation to the Russians.</p>
<p>Men of science and of law (Messieurs Muravieff and
Martens) strenuously try to prove that in the recent
call of all nations to universal peace and the present
incitement to war, because of the seizure of other
peoples' lands, there is no contradiction. Diplomatists,
in their refined French language, publish and send
out circulars in which they circumstantially and diligently
prove (though they know no one believes them)
that, after all its efforts to establish peaceful relations
(in reality, after all its efforts to deceive other countries),
the Russian Government has been compelled to
have recourse to the only means for a rational solution
of the question&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> to the murder of men. The
same thing is written by Japanese diplomatists. Scientists,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5">5</a></span>
historians, and philosophers, on their side, comparing
the present with the past, deduce from these
comparisons profound conclusions, and argue interminably
about the laws of the movement of nations,
about the relation between the yellow and white races,
or about Buddhism and Christianity, and on the basis of
these deductions and arguments justify the slaughter
of those belonging to the yellow race by Christians;
while in the same way the Japanese scientists and
philosophers justify the slaughter of those of the white
race. Journalists, without concealing their joy, try
to outdo each other, and, not hesitating at any falsehood,
however impudent and transparent, prove in all
possible ways that the Russians only are right and
strong and good in every respect, and that all the
Japanese are wrong and weak and bad in every respect,
and that all those are also bad who are inimical or may
become inimical toward the Russians&mdash;the English,
the Americans; and the same is proved likewise by
the Japanese and their supporters in relation to the
Russians.</p>
<p>Not to mention the military, who in the way of their
profession prepare for murder, crowds of so-called enlightened
people, such as professors, social reformers,
students, nobles, merchants, without being forced thereto
by anything or anybody, express the most bitter and
contemptuous feelings toward the Japanese, the English,
or the Americans, toward whom but yesterday
they were either well-disposed or indifferent; while,
without the least compulsion, they express the most
abject, servile feelings toward the Tsar (to whom, to
say the least, they were completely indifferent), assuring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6">6</a></span>
him of their unlimited love and readiness to sacrifice
their lives in his interests.</p>
<p>This unfortunate, entangled young man, recognized as
the leader of one hundred and thirty millions of people,
continually deceived and compelled to contradict himself,
confidently thanks and blesses the troops whom he
calls his own for murder in defence of lands which with
yet less right he also calls his own. All present to each
other hideous ikons in which not only no one amongst
the educated believes, but which unlearned peasants are
beginning to abandon; all bow down to the ground
before these ikons, kiss them, and pronounce pompous
and deceitful speeches in which no one really believes.</p>
<p>Wealthy people contribute insignificant portions of
their immorally acquired riches for this cause of murder
or the organization of help in connection with the work
of murder; while the poor, from whom the Government
annually collects two milliards, deem it necessary to do
likewise, giving their mites also. The Government
incites and encourages crowds of idlers, who walk about
the streets with the Tsar's portrait, singing, shouting
hurrah! and who, under pretext of patriotism, are
licensed in all kinds of excess. All over Russia, from
the Palace to the remotest village, the pastors of
churches, calling themselves Christians, appeal to that
God who has enjoined love to one's enemies&mdash;to the
God of Love Himself&mdash;to help the work of the devil
to further the slaughter of men.</p>
<p>Stupefied by prayers, sermons, exhortations, by processions,
pictures, and newspapers, the cannon's flesh,
hundreds of thousands of men, uniformly dressed, carrying
divers deadly weapons, leaving their parents, wives,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7">7</a></span>
children, with hearts of agony, but with artificial sprightliness,
go where they, risking their own lives, will
commit the most dreadful act of killing men whom
they do not know and who have done them no harm.
And they are followed by doctors and nurses, who
somehow imagine that at home they cannot serve simple,
peaceful, suffering people, but can only serve those who
are engaged in slaughtering each other. Those who
remain at home are gladdened by news of the murder
of men, and when they learn that many Japanese have
been killed they thank some one whom they call God.</p>
<p>All this is not only regarded as the manifestation of
elevated feeling, but those who refrain from such manifestations,
if they endeavor to disabuse men, are deemed
traitors and betrayers, and are in danger of being abused
and beaten by a brutalized crowd which, in defence of
its insanity and cruelty, can possess no other weapon
than brute force.</p>

<h2 class="new-h2">III</h2>

<p>It is as if there had never existed either Voltaire, or
Montaigne, or Pascal, or Swift, or Kant, or Spinoza, or
hundreds of other writers who have exposed, with great
force, the madness and futility of war, and have described
its cruelty, immorality, and savagery; and,
above all, it is as if there had never existed Jesus and
his teaching of human brotherhood and love of God
and of men.</p>
<p>One recalls all this to mind and looks around on what
is now taking place, and one experiences horror less at
the abominations of war than at that which is the
most horrible of all horrors&mdash;the consciousness of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8">8</a></span>
impotency of human reason. That which alone distinguishes
man from the animal, that which constitutes
his merit&mdash;his reason&mdash;is found to be an unnecessary,
and not only a useless, but a pernicious addition, which
simply impedes action, like a bridle fallen from a
horse's head, and entangled in his legs and only irritating
him.</p>
<p>It is comprehensible that a heathen, a Greek, a Roman,
even a mediæval Christian, ignorant of the Gospel
and blindly believing all the prescriptions of the
Church, might fight and, fighting, pride himself on his
military achievements; but how can a believing Christian,
or even a sceptic, involuntarily permeated by the
Christian ideals of human brotherhood and love which
have inspired the works of the philosophers, moralists,
and artists of our time,&mdash;how can such take a gun, or
stand by a cannon, and aim at a crowd of his fellow-men,
desiring to kill as many of them as possible?</p>
<p>The Assyrians, Romans, or Greeks might be persuaded
that in fighting they were acting not only
according to their conscience, but even fulfilling a
righteous deed. But, whether we wish it or not, we
are Christians, and however Christianity may have been
distorted, its general spirit cannot but lift us to that
higher plane of reason whence we can no longer refrain
from feeling with our whole being not only the senselessness
and the cruelty of war, but its complete opposition
to all that we regard as good and right. Therefore,
we cannot do as they did, with assurance, firmness, and
peace, and without a consciousness of our criminality,
without the desperate feeling of a murderer, who, having
begun to kill his victim, and feeling in the depths
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9">9</a></span>
of his soul the guilt of his act, proceeds to try to
stupefy or infuriate himself, to be able the better to
complete his dreadful deed. All the unnatural, feverish,
hot-headed, insane excitement which has now
seized the idle upper ranks of Russian society is merely
the symptom of their recognition of the criminality of
the work which is being done. All these insolent,
mendacious speeches about devotion to, and worship
of, the Monarch, about readiness to sacrifice life (or
one should say other people's lives, and not one's
own); all these promises to defend with one's breast
land which does not belong to one; all these senseless
benedictions of each other with various banners and
monstrous ikons; all these <i>Te Deums</i>; all these preparations
of blankets and bandages; all these detachments
of nurses; all these contributions to the fleet and to
the Red Cross presented to the Government, whose
direct duty is (whilst it has the possibility of collecting
from the people as much money as it requires), having
declared war, to organize the necessary fleet and necessary
means for attending the wounded; all these Slavonic,
pompous, senseless, and blasphemous prayers,
the utterance of which in various towns is communicated
in the papers as important news; all these processions,
calls for the national hymn, cheers; all this
dreadful, desperate newspaper mendacity, which, being
universal, does not fear exposure; all this stupefaction
and brutalization which has now taken hold of Russian
society, and which is being transmitted by degrees also
to the masses; all this is only a symptom of the guilty
consciousness of that dreadful act which is being
accomplished.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10">10</a></span></div>
<p>Spontaneous feeling tells men that what they are doing
should not be; but, as the murderer who has begun
to assassinate his victim cannot stop, so also Russian
people now imagine that the fact of the deadly work
having been commenced is an unanswerable argument
in favor of war. War has been begun, and therefore
it should go on. Thus it seems to simple, benighted,
unlearned men, acting under the influence of the petty
passions and stupefaction to which they have been subjected.
In exactly the same way the most educated
men of our time argue to prove that man does not
possess free will, and that, therefore, even were he to
understand that the work he has commenced is evil, he
can no longer cease to do it. And dazed, brutalized
men continue their dreadful work.</p>

<h2 class="new-h2">IV</h2>

<p>Ask a soldier, a private, a corporal, a non-commissioned
officer, who has abandoned his old parents, his
wife, his children, why he is preparing to kill men whom
he does not know; he will at first be astonished at your
question. He is a soldier, he has taken the oath, and
it is his duty to fulfil the orders of his commanders. If
you tell him that war&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the slaughter of men&mdash;does
not conform to the command, &ldquo;Thou shalt not
kill,&rdquo; he will say: &ldquo;And how if ours are attacked&mdash;For
the King&mdash;For the Orthodox faith?&rdquo; (One of them
said in answer to my question: &ldquo;And how if he
attacks that which is sacred?&rdquo; &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
I asked. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the banner.&rdquo;) And if you
endeavor to explain to such a soldier that God's Commandment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11">11</a></span>
is more important not only than the banner
but than anything else in the world, he will become
silent, or he will get angry and report you to the
authorities.</p>
<p>Ask an officer, a general, why he goes to the war.
He will tell you that he is a military man, and that
the military are indispensable for the defence of the
fatherland. As to murder not conforming to the spirit
of the Christian law, this does not trouble him, as either
he does not believe in this law, or, if he does, it is not
in the law itself, but in that explanation which has been
given to this law. But, above all, he, like the soldier,
in place of the personal question, what should he do
himself, always put the general question about the State,
or the fatherland. &ldquo;At the present moment, when the
fatherland is in danger, one should act, and not argue,&rdquo;
he will say.</p>
<p>Ask the diplomatists, who, by their deceits, prepare
wars, why they do it. They will tell you that the object
of their activity is the establishment of peace between
nations, and that this object is attained, not by ideal,
unrealizable theories, but by diplomatic action and
readiness for war. And, just as the military, instead
of the question concerning one's own action, place the
general question, so also diplomatists will speak about
the interests of Russia, about the unscrupulousness of
other Powers, about the balance of power in Europe,
but not about their own position and its activities.</p>
<p>Ask the journalists why, by their writings, they
incite men to war; they will say that wars in general are
necessary and useful, especially the present war, and
they will confirm this opinion of theirs by misty patriotic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12">12</a></span>
phrases, and, just like the military and diplomatist,
to the question why he, a journalist, a particular
individual, a living man, acts in a certain way, he will
speak about the general interests of the nation, about
the State, civilization, the white race. In the same
way, all those who prepare war will explain their
participation in that work. They will perhaps agree
that it would be desirable to abolish war, but at present
this is impossible. At present they as Russians and as
men who occupy certain positions, such as heads of the
nobility, representatives of local self-government, doctors,
workers of the Red Cross, are called upon to act
and not to argue. &ldquo;There is no time to argue and to
think of oneself,&rdquo; they will say, &ldquo;when there is a great
common work to be done.&rdquo; The same will be said by
the Tsar, seemingly responsible for the whole thing.
He, like the soldier, will be astonished at the question,
whether war is now necessary. He does not even
admit the idea that the war might yet be arrested. He
will say that he cannot refrain from fulfilling that
which is demanded of him by the whole nation, that,
although he does recognize that war is a great evil,
and has used, and is ready to use, all possible means
for its abolition&mdash;in the present case he could not help
declaring war, and cannot help continuing it. It is
necessary for the welfare and glory of Russia.</p>
<p>Every one of these men, to the question why he, so
and so, Ivan, Peter, Nicholas, whilst recognizing as
binding upon him the Christian law which not only
forbids the killing of one's neighbor but demands that
one should love him, serve him, why he permits himself
to participate in war; <i>i.e.</i> in violence, loot,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13">13</a></span>
murder, will infallibly answer the same thing, that
he is thus acting in the name of his fatherland, or faith,
or oath, or honor, or civilization, or the future welfare
of the whole of mankind&mdash;in general, of something
abstract and indefinite. Moreover, these men are
always so urgently occupied either by preparation for
war, or by its organization, or discussions about it, that
in their leisure time they can only rest from their
labors, and have not time to occupy themselves with
discussions about their life, regarding such discussions
as idle.</p>

<h2 class="new-h2">V</h2>

<p>Men of our Christian world and of our time are like
a man who, having missed the right turning, the further
he goes the more he becomes convinced that he is
going the wrong way. Yet the greater his doubts, the
quicker and the more desperately does he hurry on,
consoling himself with the thought that he will arrive
somewhere. But the time comes when it becomes quite
clear that the way along which he is going will lead to
nothing but a precipice, which he is already beginning
to discern before him.</p>
<p>In such a position stands the Christian humanity of
our time. It is perfectly evident that, if we continue
to live as we are now living, guided in our private lives,
as well as in the life of separate States, by the sole
desire of welfare for ourselves and for our State, and
will, as we do now, think to ensure this welfare by
violence, then, inevitably increasing the means of violence
of one against the other and of State against
State, we shall, first, keep subjecting ourselves more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14">14</a></span>
and more, transferring the major portion of our productiveness
to armaments; and, secondly, by killing in
mutual wars the best physically developed men, we
must become more and more degenerate and morally
depraved.</p>
<p>That this will be the case if we do not alter our life
is as certain as it is mathematically certain that two
non-parallel straight lines must meet. But not only
is this theoretically certain in our time; it is becoming
certain not only to thought, but also to the consciousness.
The precipice which we approach is already
becoming apparent to us, and the most simple, non-philosophizing,
and uneducated men cannot but see
that, by arming ourselves more and more against each
other and slaughtering each other in war, we, like
spiders in a jar, can come to nothing else but the
destruction of each other.</p>
<p>A sincere, serious, rational man can no longer console
himself by the thought that matters can be mended, as
was formerly supposed, by a universal empire such as
that of Rome or of Charles the Great, or Napoleon, or
by the mediæval spiritual power of the Pope, or by
Holy Alliances, by the political balance of the European
Concert, and by peaceful international tribunals,
or, as some have thought, by the increase of military
strength and the newly discovered powerful weapons
of destruction.</p>
<p>It is impossible to organize a universal empire or
republic, consisting of European States, as different
nationalities will never desire to unite into one State.
To organize international tribunals for the solution
of international disputes? But who will impose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15">15</a></span>
obedience to the decision of the tribunal upon a contending
party who has an organized army of millions
of men? To disarm? No one desires it or will begin
it. To invent yet more dreadful means of destruction&mdash;balloons
with bombs filled with suffocating gases,
shells, which men will shower upon each other from
above? Whatever may be invented, all States will
furnish themselves with similar weapons of destruction.
And cannon's flesh, as after cold weapons it submitted
to bullets, and meekly exposed itself to shells, bombs,
far-reaching guns, mitrailleuses, mines, so it will also
submit to bombs charged with suffocating gases scattered
down upon it from balloons.</p>
<p>Nothing shows more evidently than the speeches of
M. Muravieff and Professor Martens about the Japanese
war not contradicting The Hague Peace Conference&mdash;nothing
shows more obviously than these
speeches to what an extent, amongst the men of our
time, the means for the transmission of thought&mdash;speech&mdash;is
distorted, and how the capacity for clear,
rational thinking is completely lost. Thought and
speech are used for the purpose, not of serving as a
guide for human activity, but of justifying any activity,
however criminal it may be. The late Boer war
and the present Japanese war, which can at any moment
pass into a universal slaughter, have proved this
beyond all doubt. All anti-military discussions can as
little contribute to the cessation of war as the most
eloquent and persuasive considerations addressed to
fighting dogs as to its being more advantageous to
divide the piece of meat over which they are struggling
than to mutilate each other and lose the piece of meat,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16">16</a></span>
which will be carried away by some passing dog not
joining in the fight. We are dashing on toward the
precipice, cannot stop, and we are approaching its
edge.</p>
<p>For every rational man who reflects upon the position
in which humanity is now placed and upon that which
it is inevitably approaching, it cannot but be obvious
that there is no practical issue out of this position, that
one cannot devise any combination or organization
which would save us from the destruction toward
which we are inevitably rushing. Not to mention the
economical problems which become more and more
complex, those mutual relations between the States
arming themselves against each other and at any
moment ready to break out into wars clearly point to
the certain destruction toward which all so-called civilized
humanity is being carried. Then what is to be
done?</p>

<h2 class="new-h2">VI</h2>

<p>Two thousand years ago John the Baptist and then
Jesus said to men: The time is fulfilled and the Kingdom
of God is at hand; (<ins class="greek" title="metanoeite">&mu;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&omicron;&epsilon;&#x1fd6;&tau;&epsilon;</ins>) bethink yourselves
and believe in the Gospel (Mark i. 15); and if you
do not bethink yourselves you will all perish (Luke
xiii. 5).</p>
<p>But men did not listen to them, and the destruction
they foretold is already near at hand. And we men of
our time cannot but see it. We are already perishing,
and, therefore, we cannot leave unheeded that&mdash;old in
time, but for us new&mdash;means of salvation. We cannot
but see that, besides all the other calamities which flow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17">17</a></span>
from our bad and irrational life, military preparations
alone and the wars inevitably growing from them must
infallibly destroy us. We cannot but see that all the
means of escape invented by men from these evils are
found and must be found to be ineffectual, and that the
disastrous position of the nations arming themselves
against each other cannot but go on advancing continually.
And therefore the words of Jesus refer to us
and our time more than to any time or to any one.</p>
<p>Jesus said, &ldquo;Bethink yourselves&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;Let every
man interrupt the work he has begun and ask himself:
Who am I? From whence have I appeared, and in what
consists my destiny? And having answered these
questions, according to the answer decide whether that
which thou doest is in conformity with thy destiny.&rdquo;
And every man of our world and time, that is, being
acquainted with the essence of the Christian teaching,
needs only for a minute to interrupt his activity, to forget
the capacity in which he is regarded by men, be it
of Emperor, soldier, minister, or journalist, and seriously
ask himself who he is and what is his destiny&mdash;in
order to begin to doubt the utility, lawfulness,
and reasonableness of his actions. &ldquo;Before I am Emperor,
soldier, minister, or journalist,&rdquo; must say to himself
every man of our time and of the Christian world,
&ldquo;before any of these, I am a man&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> an organic
being sent by the Higher Will into a universe infinite
in time and space, in order, after staying in it for an instant,
to die&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> to disappear from it. And, therefore,
all those personal, social, and even universal human
aims which I may place before myself and which are
placed before me by men are all insignificant, owing to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18">18</a></span>
the shortness of my life as well as to the infiniteness of
the life of the universe, and should be subordinated to
that higher aim for the attainment of which I am sent
into the world. This ultimate aim, owing to my limitations,
is inaccessible to me, but it does exist (as there
must be a purpose in all that exists), and my business is
that of being its instrument&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> my destiny, my
vocation, is that of being a workman of God, of
fulfilling His work.&rdquo; And having understood this
destiny, every man of our world and time, from
Emperor to soldier, cannot but regard differently those
duties which he has taken upon himself or other men
have imposed upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before I was crowned, recognized as Emperor,&rdquo;
must the Emperor say to himself: &ldquo;before I undertook
to fulfil the duties of the head of the State, I, by the
very fact that I live, have promised to fulfil that which
is demanded of me by the Higher Will that sent me
into life. These demands I not only know, but feel in
my heart. They consist, as it is expressed in the
Christian law, which I profess, in that I should submit
to the will of God, and fulfil that which it requires of
me, that I should love my neighbor, serve him, and act
towards him as I would wish others to act towards me.
Am I doing this?&mdash;ruling men, prescribing violence,
executions, and, the most dreadful of all,&mdash;wars. Men
tell me that I ought to do this. But God says that
I ought to do something quite different. And, therefore,
however much I may be told that, as the head
of the State, I must direct acts of violence, the levying
of taxes, executions and, above all, war, that is,
the slaughter of one's neighbor, I do not wish to and
cannot do these things.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19">19</a></span></div>
<p>So must say to himself the soldier, who is taught
that he must kill men, and the minister, who deemed it
his duty to prepare for war, and the journalist who
incited to war, and every man, who puts to himself the
question, Who is he, what is his destination in life?
And the moment the head of the State will cease to
direct war, the soldier to fight, the minister to prepare
means for war, the journalist to incite thereto&mdash;then,
without any new institutions, adaptations, balance of
power, tribunals, there will of itself be destroyed that
hopeless position in which men have placed themselves,
not only in relation to war, but also to all other calamities
which they themselves inflict upon themselves.</p>
<p>So that, however strange this may appear, the most
effective and certain deliverance of men from all the
calamities which they inflict upon themselves and from
the most dreadful of all&mdash;war&mdash;is attainable, not by
any external general measures, but merely by that
simple appeal to the consciousness of each separate
man which, nineteen hundred years ago, was proposed
by Jesus&mdash;that every man bethink himself, and
ask himself, who is he, why he lives, and what he should
and should not do.</p>

<h2 class="new-h2">VII</h2>

<p>The evil from which men of our time are suffering
is produced by the fact that the majority live without
that which alone affords a rational guidance for human
activity&mdash;without religion; not that religion which
consists in belief in dogmas, in the fulfilment of rites
which afford a pleasant diversion, consolation, stimulant,
but that religion which establishes the relation of man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20">20</a></span>
to the All, to God, and, therefore, gives a general higher
direction to all human activity, and without which
people stand on the plane of animals and even lower
than they. This evil which is leading men to inevitable
destruction has manifested itself with special power
in our time, because, having lost all rational guidance
in life, and having directed all efforts to discoveries and
improvements principally in the sphere of technical
knowledge, men of our time have developed in themselves
enormous power over the forces of nature; but,
not having any guidance for the rational adaptation of
this power, they naturally have used it for the satisfaction
of their lowest and most animal propensities.</p>
<p>Bereft of religion, men possessing enormous power
over the forces of nature are like children to whom
powder or explosive gas has been given as a plaything.
Considering this power which men of our time possess,
and the way they use it, one feels that considering the
degree of their moral development men have no right,
not only to the use of railways, steam, electricity, telephones,
photography, wireless telegraphs, but even to
the simple art of manufacturing iron and steel, as all
these improvements and arts they use only for the
satisfaction of their lusts, for amusement, dissipation,
and the destruction of each other.</p>
<p>Then, what is to be done? To reject all these improvements
of life, all this power acquired by humanity&mdash;to
forget that which it has learnt? This is impossible,
however perniciously these mental acquisitions are
used; they still are acquisitions, and men cannot forget
them. To alter those combinations of nations which
have been formed during centuries and to establish new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21">21</a></span>
ones? To invent such new institutions as would hinder
the minority from deceiving and exploiting the majority?
To disseminate knowledge? All this has been tried, and
is being done with great fervor. All these imaginary
methods of improvement represent the chief methods
of self-oblivion and of diverting one's attention from
the consciousness of inevitable perdition. The boundaries
of States are changed, institutions are altered,
knowledge is disseminated; but within other boundaries,
with other organizations, with increased knowledge,
men remain the same beasts, ready any minute
to tear each other to pieces, or the same slaves they
have always been, and always will be, while they continue
to be guided, not by religious consciousness, but
by passions, theories, and external influences.</p>
<p>Man has no choice; he must be the slave of the most
unscrupulous and insolent amongst slaves, or else the
servant of God, because for man there is only one way
of being free&mdash;by uniting his will with the will of God.
People bereft of religion, some repudiating religion itself,
others recognizing as religion those external, monstrous
forms which have superseded it, and guided only
by their personal lusts, fear, human laws, and, above all,
by mutual hypnotism, cannot cease to be animals or
slaves, and no external efforts can extricate them from
this state; for only religion makes a man free. And
most of the people of our time are deprived of it.</p>

<h2 class="new-h2">VIII</h2>

<p>&ldquo;But, in order to abolish the evil from which we are
suffering,&rdquo; those will say who are preoccupied by various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22">22</a></span>
practical activities, &ldquo;it would be necessary that not
a few men only, but all men, should bethink themselves,
and that, having done so, they should uniformly understand
the destination of their lives, in the fulfilment of
the will of God and in the service of one's neighbor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this possible?&rdquo; Not only possible, do I answer,
but it is impossible that this should not take place.
It is impossible for men not to bethink themselves&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
impossible that each man should not put to himself
the question as to who he is and wherefore he
lives; for man, as a rational being, cannot live without
seeking to know why he lives, and he has always
put to himself this question, and always, according
to the degree of his development, has answered it in
his religious teaching. In our time, the inner contradiction
in which men feel themselves elicits this question
with special insistence, and demands an answer.
It is impossible for men of our time to answer this
question otherwise than by recognizing the law of life
in love to men and in the service of them, this being
for our time the only rational answer as to the meaning
of human life; and this answer nineteen hundred
years ago has been expressed in the Christian
religion and is likewise known to the vast majority of
all mankind.</p>
<p>This answer in a latent state lives in the consciousness
of all men of the Christian world of our time;
but it does not openly express itself and serve as
guidance for our life, only because, on the one hand,
those who enjoy the greatest authority, so-called scientists,
being under the coarse error that religion is a
temporary and outgrown step in the development of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23">23</a></span>
mankind and that men can live without religion, inculcate
this error to those of the masses who are beginning
to be educated; and, on the other hand, because those
in power, sometimes consciously, but often unconsciously
(being under the error that the Church faith
is Christian religion), endeavor to support and excite
in the people crude superstitions given out as the
Christian religion. If only these two deceptions were
to be destroyed, then true religion, already latent in
men of our time, would become evident and obligatory.</p>
<p>To bring this about it is necessary that, on the one
hand, men of science should understand that the principle
of the brotherhood of all men and the rule of not
doing unto others what one does not wish for oneself
is not one casual idea out of a multitude of human
theories which can be subordinated to any other considerations,
but is an incontestable principle, standing
higher than the rest, and flowing from the changeless
relation of man to that which is eternal, to God, and is
religion, all religion, and, therefore, always obligatory.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is necessary that those who
consciously or unconsciously preach crude superstitions
under the guise of Christianity should understand that
all these dogmas, sacraments, and rites which they support
and preach are not only, as they think, harmless,
but are in the highest degree pernicious, concealing
from men that central religious truth which is expressed
in the fulfilment of God's will, in the service of men,
and that the rule of acting toward others as one would
wish others to act toward oneself is not merely one of
the prescriptions of the Christian religion, but is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24">24</a></span>
whole of practical religion, as indeed is stated in the
Gospels.</p>
<p>To bring about that men of our time should uniformly
place before themselves the question of the
meaning of life, and uniformly answer it, it is only
necessary that those who regard themselves as enlightened
should cease to think and to inculcate to other
generations that religion is atavism, the survival of a
past wild state, and that for the good life of men the
spreading of education is sufficient&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the spread of
the most varied knowledge which is in some way to
bring men to justice and to a moral life. These men
should understand instead that for the good life of humanity
religion is vital, and that this religion already
exists and lives in the consciousness of the men of our
time. Men who are intentionally and unintentionally
stupefying the people by church superstitions should
cease to do so, and recognize that what is important and
binding in Christianity is not baptism, nor Communion,
nor profession of dogmas, etc., but only love to God
and to one's neighbor, and the fulfilling of the commandment
of acting toward others as one wishes
others to act toward oneself&mdash;and that in this lies
all the law and the prophets.</p>
<p>If only both pseudo-Christians and men of science
understood and preached to children and to the uneducated
these simple, clear, and necessary truths as they
now preach their complicated, confused, and unnecessary
theories, all men would uniformly understand the
meaning of their lives and recognize one and the same
duties as flowing from this meaning.</p>

<h2>IX</h2>

<p>But &ldquo;How are we to act now, immediately among
ourselves, in Russia, at this moment, when our foes
have already attacked us, are killing our people, and
threatening us; what should be the action,&rdquo; I shall be
asked, &ldquo;of a Russian soldier, officer, general, Tsar, private
individual? Are we, forsooth, to allow our enemies
to ruin our possessions, to seize the productions
of our labors, to carry away prisoners, or kill our
men? What are we to do now that this thing has
begun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But before the work of war was commenced, by
whomsoever it was commenced&mdash;every awakened man
must answer&mdash;before all else the work of my life was
commenced. And the work of my life has nothing in
common with recognition of the rights of the Chinese,
Japanese, or Russians to Port Arthur. The work of
my life consists in fulfilling the will of Him who sent
me into this life. This will is known to me. This will
is that I should love my neighbor and serve him.
Then why should I, following temporary, casual, irrational,
and cruel demands, deviate from the known
eternal and changeless law of all my life? If there be
a God, He will not ask me when I die (which may
happen at any moment) whether I retained Chi-nam-po
with its timber stores, or Port Arthur, or even that conglomeration
which is called the Russian Empire, which
He did not confide to my care; but He will ask me
what I have done with that life which He put at my
disposal;&mdash;did I use it for the purpose for which it
was predestined, and under the conditions for fulfilling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26">26</a></span>
which it was intrusted to me? Have I fulfilled His
law?</p>
<p>So that to this question as to what is to be done now,
when war is commenced, for me, a man who understands
his destiny, whatever position I may occupy, there
can be no other answer than this, whatever be my circumstances,
whether the war be commenced or not,
whether thousands of Russians or Japanese be killed,
whether not only Port Arthur be taken, but St. Petersburg
and Moscow&mdash;I cannot act otherwise than as God
demands of me, and that therefore I as a man can neither
directly nor indirectly, neither by directing, nor by helping,
nor by inciting to it, participate in war; I cannot,
I do not wish to, and I will not. What will happen
immediately or soon, from my ceasing to do that which
is contrary to the will of God, I do not and cannot
know; but I believe that from the fulfilment of the
will of God there can follow nothing but that which
is good for me and for all men.</p>
<p>You speak with horror about what might happen
if we Russians at this moment ceased to fight, and
surrendered to the Japanese what they desire from us.
But if it be true that the salvation of mankind from
brutalization and self-destruction lies only in the establishment
amongst men of that true religion which
demands that we should love our neighbor and serve
him (with which it is impossible to disagree), then
every war, every hour of war, and my participation in
it, only renders more difficult and distant the realization
of this only possible salvation.</p>
<p>So that, even if one places oneself on the unstable
point of view of defining actions according to their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27">27</a></span>
presumed consequences&mdash;even then the surrender to
the Japanese by the Russians of all which the former
desire of us, besides the unquestionable advantage
of the cessation of ruin and slaughter, would be an
approach to the only means of the salvation of mankind
from destruction; whereas the continuance of the
war, however it may end, will be a postponement of
that only means of salvation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet even if this be so,&rdquo; it is replied, &ldquo;wars can
cease only when all men, or the majority, will refuse
to participate in them. But the refusal of one man,
whether he be Tsar or soldier, would only, unnecessarily,
and without the slightest profit to any one, ruin his life.
If the Russian Tsar were now to throw up the war, he
would be dethroned, perhaps killed, in order to get rid
of him; if an ordinary man were to refuse military service,
he would be sent to a penal battalion and perhaps
shot. Why, then, without the slightest use should
one throw away one's life, which may be profitable to
society?&rdquo; is the common question of those who do not
think of the destination of their life and therefore do
not understand it.</p>
<p>But this is not what is said and felt by any man who
understands the destination of his life&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> by any
religious man. Such a man is guided in his activity
not by the presumed consequences of his action, but by
the consciousness of the destination of his life. A factory
workman goes to his factory and in it accomplishes
the work which is allotted him without considering
what will be the consequences of his labor. In the
same way a soldier acts, carrying out the will of his
commanders. So acts a religious man in fulfilling the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28">28</a></span>
work prescribed to him by God, without arguing as to
what precisely will come of that work. Therefore for
a religious man there is no question as to whether many
or few men act as he does, or of what may happen to
him if he does that which he should do. He knows
that besides life and death nothing can happen, and that
life and death are in the hands of God whom he obeys.</p>
<p>A religious man acts thus and not otherwise, not because
he desires to act thus, nor because it is advantageous
to himself or to other men, but because, believing
that his life is in the hands of God, he cannot act otherwise.</p>
<p>In this lies the distinction of the activity of religious
men; and therefore it is that the salvation of men from
the calamities which they inflict upon themselves can
be realized only in that degree in which they are guided
in their lives, not by advantage nor arguments, but by
religious consciousness.</p>

<h2 class="new-h2">X</h2>

<p>&ldquo;But how about the enemies that attack us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love your enemies, and ye will have none,&rdquo; is said
in the teaching of the Twelve Apostles. This answer
is not merely words, as those may imagine who are
accustomed to think that the recommendation of love
to one's enemies is something hyperbolical, and signifies
not that which expressed, but something else. This
answer is the indication of a very clear and definite
activity, and of its consequences.</p>
<p>To love one's enemies&mdash;the Japanese, the Chinese,
those yellow people toward whom benighted men are
now endeavoring to excite our hatred&mdash;to love them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29">29</a></span>
means not to kill them for the purpose of having the
right of poisoning them with opium, as did the English;
not to kill them in order to seize their land, as was
done by the French, the Russians, and the Germans;
not to bury them alive in punishment for injuring roads,
not to tie them together by their hair, not to drown
them in their river Amur, as did the Russians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A disciple is not above his master.&hellip; It is
enough for a disciple that he be as his master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To love the yellow people, whom we call our foes,
means, not to teach them under the name of Christianity
absurd superstitions about the fall of man, redemption,
resurrection, etc., not to teach them the art of deceiving
and killing others, but to teach them justice, unselfishness,
compassion, love&mdash;and that not by words, but by
the example of our own good life. And what have we
been doing to them, and are still doing?</p>
<p>If we did indeed love our enemies, if even now we
began to love our enemies, the Japanese, we would have
no enemy.</p>
<p>Therefore, however strange it may appear to those
occupied with military plans, preparations, diplomatic
considerations, administrative, financial, economical
measures, revolutionary, socialistic propaganda, and
various unnecessary sciences, by which they think to
save mankind from its calamities, the deliverance of
man, not only from the calamities of war, but also from
all the calamities which men inflict upon themselves,
will take place not through emperors or kings instituting
peace alliances, not through those who would
dethrone emperors, kings, or restrain them by constitutions,
or substitute republics for monarchies, not by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30">30</a></span>
peace conferences, not by the realization of socialistic
programmes, not by victories or defeats on land or sea,
not by libraries or universities, nor by those futile
mental exercises which are now called science; but
only by there being more and more of those simple
men who, like the Dukhobors, Drojjin, Olkhovik, in
Russia, the Nazarenes in Austria, Condatier in France,
Tervey in Holland, and others, having placed as their
object not external alterations of life, but the closest
fulfilment in themselves of the will of Him who has
sent them into life, will direct all their powers to this
realization. Only such people realizing the Kingdom
of God in themselves, in their souls, will establish,
without directly aiming at this purpose, that external
Kingdom of God which every human soul is longing
for.</p>
<p>Salvation will come to pass only in this one way and
not in any other. Therefore what is now being done
by those who, ruling men, inspire them with religious
and patriotic superstitions, exciting in them exclusiveness,
hatred, and murder, as well as by those who, for
the purpose of freeing men from slavery and oppression,
invoke them to violent external revolution, or think
that the acquisition by men of very much incidental
and for the most part unnecessary information will of
itself bring them to a good life&mdash;all this, by distracting
men from what alone they need, only removes them
further from the possibility of salvation.</p>
<p>The evil from which the men of the Christian world
suffer is that they have temporarily lost religion.</p>
<p>Some people, having come to see the discord between
the existing religion and the degree of mental and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31">31</a></span>
scientific development attained by humanity at the
present time, have decided that in general no religion
whatever is necessary. They live without religion and
preach the uselessness of any religion of whatever kind.
Others, holding to that distorted form of the Christian
religion which is now preached, likewise live without
religion, professing empty external forms, which cannot
serve as guidance for men.</p>
<p>Yet a religion which answers to the demands of our
time does exist and is known to all men, and in a latent
state lives in the hearts of men of the Christian world.
Therefore that this religion should become evident to
and binding upon all men, it is only necessary that educated
men&mdash;the leaders of the masses&mdash;should understand
that religion is necessary to man, that without
religion men cannot live a good life, and that what
they call science cannot replace religion; and that
those in power and who support the old empty forms
of religion should understand that what they support
and preach under the form of religion is not only not
religion, but is the chief obstacle to men's appropriating
the true religion which they already know, and which
can alone deliver them from their calamities. So that
the only certain means of man's salvation consists
merely in ceasing to do that which hinders men from
assimilating the true religion which already lives in
their consciousness.</p>

<p>I had finished this writing when news came of the
destruction of six hundred innocent lives opposite Port
Arthur. It would seem that the useless suffering and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32">32</a></span>
death of these unfortunate deluded men who have needlessly
and so dreadfully perished ought to disabuse
those who were the cause of this destruction. I am not
alluding to Makaroff and other officers&mdash;all these men
knew what they were doing, and wherefore, and they
voluntarily, for personal advantage, for ambition, did as
they did, disguising themselves in pretended patriotism,
a pretence not condemned merely because it is universal.
I allude rather to those unfortunate men drawn
from all parts of Russia, who, by the help of religious
fraud, and under fear of punishment, have been torn
from an honest, reasonable, useful, laborious family life,
driven to the other end of the world, placed on a cruel,
senseless machine for slaughter, and torn to bits, drowned
along with this stupid machine in a distant sea, without
any need or any possibility of advantage from all their
privations, efforts, and sufferings, or from the death
which overtook them.</p>
<p>In 1830, during the Polish war, the adjutant Vilijinsky
sent to St. Petersburg by Klopitsky, in a conversation
held in French with Dibitch, in answer to the
latter's demand that the Russian troops should enter
Poland, said to him:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Maréchal, I think that in that case it
will be quite impossible for the Polish nation to accept
this manifesto.&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe me, the Emperor will make no further
concessions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I foresee that, unhappily, there will be war,
that much blood will be shed, there will be many unfortunate
victims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not think so; at most there will be ten thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33">33</a></span>
who will perish on both sides, and that is all,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> said
Dibitch in his German accent, quite confident that he,
together with another man as cruel and foreign to Russian
and Polish life as he was himself,&mdash;Nicholas I,&mdash;had the
right to condemn or not to condemn to death ten or a
hundred thousand Russians and Poles.</p>
<p>One hardly believes that this could have been, so
senseless and dreadful is it,&mdash;and yet it was; sixty
thousand maintainers of their families lost their lives
owing to the will of those men. And now the same
thing is taking place.</p>
<p>In order not to let the Japanese into Manchuria, and
to expel them from Korea, not ten thousand, but fifty
and more thousands will, according to all probability,
be necessary. I do not know whether Nicholas II and
Kuropatkin say like Dibitch in so many words that
not more than fifty thousand lives will be necessary for
this on the Russian side alone, only and only that; but
they think it&mdash;they cannot but think it, because the
work they are doing speaks for itself; that ceaseless
stream of unfortunate, deluded Russian peasants now
being transported by thousands to the Far East&mdash;these
are those same not more than fifty thousand
live Russian men whom Nicholas Romanoff and Alexis
Kuropatkin have decided they may get killed, and who
will be killed, in support of those stupidities, robberies,
and every kind of abomination which were accomplished
in China and Korea by immoral ambitious men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34">34</a></span>
now sitting peacefully in their palaces and expecting
new glory and new advantage and profit from the
slaughter of these fifty thousand unfortunate, defrauded
Russian workingmen guilty of nothing and gaining
nothing by their sufferings and death. For other
people's land, to which the Russians have no right,
which has been criminally seized from its legitimate
owners, and which, in reality, is not even necessary
to the Russians&mdash;and also for certain dark dealings
by speculators, who in Korea wished to gain money
out of other people's forests&mdash;many millions of money
are spent, <i>i.e.</i> a great part of the labor of the whole
of the Russian people, while the future generations of
this people are bound by debts, its best workmen are
withdrawn from labor, and scores of thousands of its
sons are mercilessly doomed to death; and the destruction
of these unfortunate men is already begun.
More than this: the war is being managed by those
who have hatched it so badly, so negligently, all is so
unexpected, so unprepared, that, as one paper admits,
Russia's chief chance of success lies in the fact that
it possesses inexhaustible human material. It is upon
this that those rely who send to death scores of thousands
of Russian men!</p>
<p>It is frankly said that the regrettable reverses of
our fleet must be compensated on the land. In plain
language this means that if the authorities have badly
directed things on sea, and by their negligence have
destroyed not only the nation's millions, but thousands
of lives, we can make it up by condemning to death
on land several more scores of thousands!</p>
<p>When crawling locusts cross rivers, it happens that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35">35</a></span>
the lower layers are drowned until from the bodies of
the drowned is formed a bridge over which the upper
ranks can pass. In the same way are the Russian
people being disposed of. Thus the first lower layer
is already beginning to drown, indicating the way to
other thousands, who will all likewise perish.</p>
<p>And are the originators, directors, and supporters
of this dreadful work beginning to understand their
sin, their crime? Not in the least. They are quite
persuaded that they have fulfilled, and are fulfilling,
their duty, and they are proud of their activity. People
speak of the loss of the brave Makaroff, who, as
all agree, was able to kill men very cleverly; they
deplore the loss of a drowned excellent machine of
slaughter which had cost so many millions of roubles;
they discuss the question of how to find another murderer
as capable as the poor benighted Makaroff; they
invent new, still more efficacious, tools of slaughter; and
all the guilty men engaged in this dreadful work,
from the Tsar to the humblest journalist, all with one
voice call for new insanities, new cruelties, for the
increase of brutality and hatred of one's fellow-men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Makaroff is not the only man in Russia, and every
admiral placed in his position will follow in his steps
and will continue the plan and the idea of Makaroff,
who has nobly perished in the strife,&rdquo; writes the <i>Novoe
Vremya</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us earnestly pray God for those who have laid
down their lives for the sacred Fatherland, without
doubting for one moment that the Fatherland will
give us new sons, equally virtuous, for the further
struggle, and will find in them an inexhaustible store
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36">36</a></span>
of strength for a worthy completion of the work,&rdquo; writes
the St. Petersburg <i>Viedomosti</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ripe nation will draw no other conclusion from
the defeat, however unprecedented, than that we
should continue, develop, and conclude the strife;
therefore let us find in ourselves new strength; new
heroes of the spirit will arise,&rdquo; writes the <i>Russ</i>,&mdash;and
so forth.</p>
<p>So murder and every kind of crime go on with
greater fury. People enthusiastically admire the
martial spirit of the volunteers who, having come
unexpectedly upon fifty of their fellow-men, slay all of
them, or take possession of a village and slaughter all
its population, or hang or shoot those accused of being
spies&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> of doing the very same thing which is
regarded as indispensable and is constantly done on
our side. News about these crimes is reported in pompous
telegrams to their chief director, the Tsar, who, in
return, sends to his virtuous troops his blessing on the
continuation of such deeds.</p>
<p>Is it not evident that, if there be a salvation from this
position, it is only one: that one which Jesus teaches?&mdash;&ldquo;Seek
ye first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness
(that which is within you), and all the rest&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
all that practical welfare toward which man is
striving&mdash;will of itself be realized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such is the law of life: practical welfare is attained
not when man strives toward this practical welfare&mdash;such
striving, on the contrary, for the most part
removes man from the attainment of what he seeks;
but only when man, without thinking of the attainment
of practical welfare, strives toward the most perfect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37">37</a></span>
fulfilment of that which before God, before the Source
and Law of his life, he regards as right. Then only,
incidentally, is practical welfare also attained.</p>
<p>So that the true salvation of men is only one thing:
the fulfilment of the will of God by each individual
man within himself&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> in that portion of the universe
which alone is subject to his power. In this is
the chief, the only, destiny and duty of every individual
man, and at the same time this is the only
means by which every individual man can influence
others; and, therefore, to this, and to this only, should
all the efforts of every man be directed.</p>
<p>May 2, 1904.</p>

<h2 class="new-h2">XII</h2>

<p>I had only just despatched the last of the preceding
pages of this paper when the dreadful news came of a
new iniquity committed in regard to the Russian people
by those light-minded men who, crazed with power,
have appropriated the right of managing them. Again
coarse and servile slaves of slaves, dressed up in various
dazzling attires&mdash;varieties of Generals wishing to distinguish
themselves, or to earn the right to add one
more little star, fingle fangle, or scrap of ribbon to
their idiotic glaring get-up, or else from stupidity or
carelessness&mdash;again these miserable men have destroyed
amid dreadful sufferings thousands of those
honorable, kind, hard-working laborers who feed them.
And again this iniquity not only does not cause those
responsible for it to reflect and repent, but one hears
and reads only about its being necessary as speedily
as possible to mutilate and slaughter a greater number
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38">38</a></span>
of men, and to ruin still more families, both Russian
and Japanese.</p>
<p>More than this, to prepare men for fresh iniquities
of this kind, the perpetrators of these crimes, far from
recognizing what is evident to all&mdash;viz. that for the Russians
this event, even from their patriotic, military point
of view, was a scandalous defeat&mdash;endeavor to assure
credulous people that these unfortunate Russian laboring
men&mdash;lured into a trap like cattle into a slaughterhouse,
of whom several thousands have been killed and
maimed merely because one General did not understand
what another General had said&mdash;have performed an
act of heroism because those who could not run away
were killed and those who did run away remained
alive. As to the fact that one of these immoral and
cruel men, distinguished by the titles of Generals,
Admirals, drowned a quantity of peaceful Japanese,
this is also described as a great and glorious act of
heroism, which must gladden the hearts of Russians.
And in all the papers are reprinted this awful appeal
to murder:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the two thousand Russian soldiers killed on the
Yalu, together with the maimed <i>Retvisan</i> and her
sister ships, with our lost torpedo-boats, teach our
cruisers with what devastation they must break in upon
the shores of base Japan. She has sent her soldiers to
shed Russian blood, and no quarter should be afforded
her. Now one cannot&mdash;it is sinful&mdash;be sentimental;
we must fight; we must direct such heavy blows that
the memory of them shall freeze the treacherous hearts
of the Japanese. Now is the time for the cruisers to
go out to sea to reduce to ashes the towns of Japan,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39">39</a></span>
flying as a dreadful calamity along its shores. No
more sentimentality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The frightful work commenced is continued. Loot,
violence, murder, hypocrisy, theft, and, above all, the
most fearful fraud&mdash;the distortion of religious teachings,
both Christian and Buddhistic&mdash;continue. The
Tsar, the chief responsible person, continues to review
the troops, to thank, reward, and encourage them; he
issues an edict for the calling out of the reserves;
his faithful subjects again and again lay down their
property and lives at the feet of him they call, only
with their lips, their adored Monarch. On the other
hand, desiring to distinguish themselves before each
other in deeds and not in words only, they tear away
the fathers and the bread-winners from their orphaned
families, preparing them for slaughter. The worse the
position of Russia, the more recklessly do the journalists
lie, transforming shameful defeats into victories, knowing
that no one will contradict them; and they quietly
collect money from subscriptions and sales. The more
money and labor of the people is devoted to the war,
the more is grabbed by various authorities and speculators,
who know that no one will convict them because
every one is doing the same. The military, trained for
murder, having passed years in a school of inhumanity,
coarseness, and idleness, rejoice&mdash;poor men&mdash;because,
besides an increase of their salary, the slaughter of
superiors opens vacancies for their promotion. Christian
pastors continue to invite men to the greatest of
crimes, continue to commit sacrilege, praying God to
help the work of war; and, instead of condemning, they
justify and praise that pastor who, with the cross in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40">40</a></span>
his hands on the very scene of murder, encouraged men
to the crime. The same thing is going on in Japan.
The benighted Japanese go in for murder with yet
greater fervor, owing to their victories; the Mikado
also reviews and rewards his troops; various Generals
boast of their bravery, imagining that, having learned to
kill, they have acquired enlightenment. So, too, groan
the unfortunate working people torn from useful labor
and from their families. So their journalists also lie and
rejoice over their gains. Also probably&mdash;for where
murder is elevated into virtue every kind of vice is
bound to flourish&mdash;also probably all kinds of commanders
and speculators earn money; and Japanese theologians
and religious teachers no less than the masters in
the techniques of armament do not remain behind the
Europeans in the techniques of religious deceit and
sacrilege, but distort the great Buddhistic teaching by
not only permitting but justifying that murder which
Buddha forbade. The Buddhistic scientist, Soyen-Shaku,
ruling over eight hundred monasteries, explains
that although Buddha forbade manslaughter he also
said he could never be at peace until all beings are
united in the infinitely loving heart of all things, and
that, therefore, in order to bring into harmony that
which is discordant it is necessary to fight and to kill
men.<a name="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41">41</a></span></div>
<p>It is as if there never had existed the Christian and
Buddhistic teaching about the unity of the human spirit,
the brotherhood of men, love, compassion, the sacredness
of human life. Men, both Japanese and Russians,
already enlightened by the truth, yet like wild animals,
nay, worse than wild animals, throw themselves upon
each other with the sole desire to destroy as many lives
as possible. Thousands of unfortunates groan and
writhe in cruel sufferings and die in agony in Japanese
and Russian field hospitals, asking themselves in bewilderment
why this fearful thing was done with them,
while other thousands are already rotting in the earth
or on the earth, or floating in the sea, in swollen decomposition.
And scores of thousands of wives, fathers,
mothers, children, are bemoaning their bread-winners;
uselessly destroyed. Yet all this is still too little; new
and newer victims are being prepared. The chief
concern of the Russian organizers of slaughter is that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42">42</a></span>
on the Russian side the stream of food for cannon&mdash;three
thousand men per day doomed to destruction&mdash;should
not be interrupted for one minute. The Japanese
are preoccupied with the same thing. The locusts are
incessantly being driven down into the river in order
that the rows behind may pass over the bodies.</p>
<p>When will this cease, and the deceived people at last
recover themselves and say: &ldquo;Well, go you yourselves,
you heartless Tsars, Mikados, Ministers, Bishops, priests,
generals, editors, speculators, or however you may be
called, go you yourselves under these shells and bullets,
but we do not wish to go and we will not go. Leave
us in peace, to plough, and sow, and build,&mdash;and also
to feed you.&rdquo; It would be so natural to say this now,
when amongst us in Russia resounds the weeping and
wailing of hundreds of thousands of mothers, wives,
and children, from whom are being snatched away their
bread-earners, the so-called &ldquo;reserve.&rdquo; These same
men, the majority of the reserve, are able to read; they
know what the Far East is; they know that war is going
on, not for anything which is in the least necessary to
Russia, but for some dealings in strange land, leased
lands, as they themselves call them, on which it seemed
advantageous to some corrupt speculators to build railways
and so gain profit; also they know, or might
know, that they will be killed like sheep in a slaughterhouse,
since the Japanese possess the latest improvements
in tools of murder, which we do not, as the
Russian authorities who are sending these people to
death had not thought in time of furnishing themselves
with the same weapons as the Japanese. Knowing all
this, it would indeed be so natural to say, &ldquo;Go you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43">43</a></span>
those who have brought on this work, all you to whom
war is necessary, and who justify it; go you, and face
the Japanese bullets and mines, but we will not go,
because we not only do not need to do this, but we
cannot understand how it can be necessary to any one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But no, they do not say this; they go, and they will
continue to go; they cannot but go as long as they fear
that which ruins the body and not that which ruins both
the body and the soul. &ldquo;Whether we shall be killed,&rdquo;
they argue, &ldquo;or maimed in these chinnampos, or whatever
they are called, whither we are driven, we do not
know; it yet may happen that we shall get through
safely, and, moreover, with rewards and glory, like
those sailors who are now being feasted all over Russia
because the Japanese bombs and bullets did not hit
them, but somebody else; whereas should we refuse,
we should be certainly sent to prison, starved, beaten,
exiled to the province of Yakoutsk, perhaps even killed
immediately.&rdquo; So with despair in their hearts, leaving
behind a good rational life, leaving their wives and
their children,&mdash;they go.</p>
<p>Yesterday I met a Reservist soldier accompanied by
his mother and wife. All three were riding in a cart;
he had had a drop too much; his wife's face was swollen
with tears. He turned to me:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by to thee! Lyof Nikolaevitch, off to the
Far East.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, art thou going to fight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, some one has to fight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one need fight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reflected for a moment. &ldquo;But what is one to do;
where can one escape?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44">44</a></span></div>
<p>I saw that he had understood me, had understood
that the work to which he was being sent was an evil
work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where can one escape?&rdquo; That is the precise expression
of that mental condition which in the official and
journalistic world is translated into the words&mdash;&ldquo;For
the Faith, the Tsar, and the Fatherland.&rdquo; Those who,
abandoning their hungry families, go to suffering, to
death, say as they feel, &ldquo;Where can one escape?&rdquo;
Whereas those who sit in safety in their luxurious
palaces say that all Russian men are ready to sacrifice
their lives for their adored Monarch, and for the glory
and greatness of Russia.</p>
<p>Yesterday, from a peasant I know, I received two
letters, one after the other. This is the first:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Lyof Nikolaevitch,&mdash;Well, to-day I have
received the official announcement of my call to the
Service; to-morrow I must present myself at the headquarters.
That is all. And after that&mdash;to the Far
East to meet the Japanese bullets. About my own
and my household's grief I will not tell you; it is not
you who will fail to understand all the horror of my
position and the horrors of war; all this you have long
ago painfully realized, and you understand it all. How
I have longed to visit you, to have a talk with you!
I had written to you a long letter in which I described
the torments of my soul; but I had not had time to
copy it, when I received my summons. What is my
wife to do now with her four children? As an old
man, of course, you cannot do anything yourself for
my folks, but you might ask some of your friends in
their leisure to visit my orphaned family. I beg you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45">45</a></span>
earnestly that if my wife proves unable to bear the
agony of her helplessness with her burden of children
and makes up her mind to go to you for help and
counsel, you will receive and console her. Although
she does not know you personally, she believes in your
word, and that means much. I was not able to resist
the summons, but I say beforehand that through me
not one Japanese family shall be orphaned. My God!
how dreadful is all this&mdash;how distressing and painful
to abandon all by which one lives and in which one is
concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second letter is as follows: &ldquo;Kindest Lyof
Nikolaevitch, Only one day of actual service has passed,
and I have already lived through an eternity of most
desperate torments. From 8 o'clock in the morning
till 9 in the evening we have been crowded and knocked
about to and fro in the barrack yard, like a herd of
cattle. The comedy of medical examination was three
times repeated, and those who had reported themselves
ill did not receive even ten minutes' attention before
they were marked &lsquo;Satisfactory.&rsquo; When we, these two
thousand satisfactory individuals, were driven from
the military commander to the barracks, along the road
spread out for almost a verst stood a crowd of relatives,
mothers, and wives with infants in arms; and if you
had only heard and seen how they clasped their fathers,
husbands, sons, and hanging round their necks wailed
hopelessly! Generally I behave in a reserved way and
can restrain my feelings, but I could not hold out, and
I also wept. [In journalistic language this same is
expressed thus: &ldquo;The upheaval of patriotic feeling is
immense.&rdquo;] Where is the standard that can measure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46">46</a></span>
all this immensity of woe now spreading itself over
almost one-third of the world? And we, we are now
that food for cannon, which in the near future will
be offered as sacrifice to the God of vengeance and
horror. I cannot manage to establish my inner balance.
Oh! how I execrate myself for this double-mindedness
which prevents my serving one Master and God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This man does not yet sufficiently believe that what
destroys the body is not dreadful, but that which
destroys both the body and the soul, therefore he cannot
refuse to go; yet while leaving his own family he
promises beforehand that through him not one Japanese
family shall be orphaned; he believes in the chief law
of God, the law of all religions&mdash;to act toward others
as one wishes others to act toward oneself. Of such
men more or less consciously recognizing this law, there
are in our time, not in the Christian world alone, but
in the Buddhistic, Mahomedan, Confucian, and Brahminic
world, not only thousands but millions.</p>
<p>There exist true heroes, not those who are now being
fêted because, having wished to kill others, they
were not killed themselves, but true heroes, who are
now confined in prisons and in the province of Yakoutsk
for having categorically refused to enter the ranks of
murderers, and who have preferred martyrdom to this
departure from the law of Jesus. There are also such
as he who writes to me, who go, but who will not kill.
But also that majority which goes without thinking,
and endeavors not to think of what it is doing, still
in the depth of its soul does now already feel that it is
doing an evil deed by obeying authorities who tear men
from labor and from their families and send them to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47">47</a></span>
needless slaughter of men, repugnant to their soul and
their faith; and they go only because they are so entangled
on all sides that&mdash;&ldquo;Where can one escape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile those who remain at home not only feel
this, but know and express it. Yesterday in the high
road I met some peasants returning from Toula. One
of them was reading a leaflet as he walked by the side
of his cart.</p>
<p>I asked, &ldquo;What is that&mdash;a telegram?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is yesterday's,&mdash;but here is one of to-day.&rdquo;
He took another out of his pocket. We stopped. I
read it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have seen what took place yesterday
at the station,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it was dreadful. Wives,
children, more than a thousand of them, weeping.
They surrounded the train, but were allowed no further.
Strangers wept, looking on. One woman from
Toula gasped and fell down dead. Five children.
They have since been placed in various institutions; but
the father was driven away all the same.&hellip; What
do we want with this Manchuria, or whatever it is
called? There is sufficient land here. And what a
lot of people and of property has been destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, the relation of men to war is now quite different
from that which formerly existed, even so lately as the
year '77. That which is now taking place never took
place before.</p>
<p>The papers set forth that, during the receptions of
the Tsar, who is travelling about Russia for the purpose
of hypnotizing the men who are being sent to murder,
indescribable enthusiasm is manifested amongst the
people. As a matter of fact, something quite different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48">48</a></span>
is being manifested. From all sides one hears reports
that in one place three Reservists have hanged themselves;
in another spot, two more; in yet another, about
a woman whose husband had been taken away bringing
her children to the conscription committee-room and
leaving them there; while another hanged herself in
the yard of the military commander. All are dissatisfied,
gloomy, exasperated. The words, &ldquo;For the Faith,
the King, and the Fatherland,&rdquo; the National Anthem,
and shouts of &ldquo;Hurrah&rdquo; no longer act upon people as
they once did. Another warfare of a different kind&mdash;the
struggling consciousness of the deceit and sinfulness
of the work to which people are being called&mdash;is more
and more taking possession of the people.</p>
<p>Yes, the great strife of our time is not that now taking
place between the Japanese and the Russians, nor
that which may blaze up between the white and yellow
races, not that strife which is carried on by mines,
bombs, bullets, but that spiritual strife which without
ceasing has gone on and is now going on between the
enlightened consciousness of mankind now waiting for
manifestation and that darkness and that burden which
surrounds and oppresses mankind.</p>
<p>In His own time Jesus yearned in expectation, and
said, &ldquo;I came to cast fire upon the earth, and how
I wish that it were already kindled.&rdquo; Luke xii. 49.</p>
<p>That which Jesus longed for is being accomplished,
the fire is being kindled. Then do not let us check it,
but let us spread and serve it.</p>
<p>13 May, 1904.</p>
<p>I should never finish this paper if I were to continue
to add to it all that corroborates its essential idea.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49">49</a></span>
Yesterday the news came in of the sinking of the
Japanese ironclads; and in the so-called higher circles
of Russian fashionable, rich, intellectual society they
are, without the slightest conscientious scruples, rejoicing
at the destruction of a thousand human lives. Yet
to-day I have received from a simple seaman, a man
standing on the lowest plane of society, the following
letter:<a name="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Much respected Lyof Nikolaevitch, I greet you with
a low bow, with love, much respected Lyof Nikolaevitch.
I have read your book. It was very pleasant
reading for me. I have been a great lover of reading
your works. Well, Lyof Nikolaevitch, we are now in a
state of war, please write to me whether it is agreeable
to God or not that our commanders compel us to kill.
I beg you, Lyof Nikolaevitch, write to me please
whether or not the truth now exists on earth. Tell
me, Lyof Nikolaevitch. In church here a prayer is
being read, the priest mentions the Christ-loving
army. Is it true or not that God loves war? I pray
you, Lyof Nikolaevitch, have you got any books from
which I could see whether truth exists on earth or not?
Send me such books. What they cost, I will pay. I
beg you, Lyof Nikolaevitch, do not neglect my request.
If there are no books then send me a letter. I will
be very glad when I receive a letter from you. I will
await your letter with impatience. Good-by for the
present. I remain alive and well and wish the same to
you from the Lord God. Good health and good success
in your work.&rdquo;</p>

Vilijinsky adds on his own behalf, &ldquo;The Field-Marshal did not
then think that more than sixty thousand Russians alone would perish
in this war, not so much from the enemy's fire as from disease&mdash;nor
that he would himself be amongst their number.&rdquo;</p></div>

In the article it is said: &ldquo;This triple world is my own possession.
All the things therein are my own children &hellip; the ten thousand
things in this world are no more than the reflections of my own self.
They come from the one source. They partake of the one body.
Therefore I cannot rest, until every being, even the smallest possible
fragment of existence, is settled down to its proper appointment.&hellip;
This is the position taken by the Buddha, and we, his humble followers,
are but to walk in his wake. Why, then, do we fight at all?
Because we do not find this world as it ought to be. Because there
are here so many perverted creatures, so many wayward thoughts, so
many ill-directed hearts, due to ignorant subjectivity. For this reason
Buddhists are never tired of combating all productions of ignorance,
and their fight must be to the bitter end. They will show no quarter.
They will mercilessly destroy the very root from which arises the misery
of this life. To accomplish this end, they will never be afraid of
sacrificing their lives.&hellip;&rdquo; There follow, just as is usual with us,
entangled arguments about self-sacrifice and kindness, about the transmigration
of souls and about much else&mdash;all this for the sole purpose
of concealing the simple and clear commandment of Buddha: not to
kill. Further it is said: &ldquo;The hand that is raised to strike and the
eye that is fixed to take aim do not belong to the individual, but are
the instruments utilized by a principle higher than transient existence.&rdquo;
